            Sarcosuchus:
        </h2>
        <p id="sarcoText">
           A giant crocodilian from the Early Cretaceous period, Sarcosuchus was one of the largest known crocodilians. It lived in what is now Africa and South America and was a formidable predator measuring up to 40 feet in length. Its large size and powerful jaws made it an efficient hunter, and it likely preyed on a variety of animals including dinosaurs, fish, and even other crocodilians. It is often referred to as "SuperCroc" due to its massive size and strength. There are no real modern day animals that can compare to it. It is a true monster of the past!

        <h2 id="mosaHeader">
            Mosasaurus:
        </h2>
        <p id="mosaText">
            A large marine reptile from the Late Cretaceous period, Mosasaurus was one of the largest known mosasaurs. It lived in what is now North America and Europe and was a formidable predator measuring up to 60 feet in length. Its long, powerful tail and sharp teeth made it an efficient hunter, and it likely preyed on a variety of marine animals including fish, sharks, and even other mosasaurs. They really make modern sea monsters look like nothing!

        <p id="foughtText">
            If these 2 legendary creatures were to meet in a fight, it would be a battle for the ages. Mosasaurus would likely use its size and strength to overpower Sarcosuchus, while Sarcosuchus would use its powerful jaws and sharp teeth to defend itself. It is difficult to say who would win in this hypothetical battle, but it would certainly be an epic showdown between two of the most fearsome predators of their time. My personal opinion would be in favor of the Mosasaurus though. Such awesome dinosaurs!
